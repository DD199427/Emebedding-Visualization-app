or the
Second World War
(1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) wasa
global conflict
between two coalitions: the
Allies
and the
Axis powers
.
Nearly all of theworld's countries
participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of
totalwar
.
Tanks
and
aircraft played major roles
, enabling the
strategic bombing
of cities anddelivery of the
first and only nuclear weapons
ever used in war. World War II was the
deadliest conflict
in history, resulting in
70 to 85 million deaths
, more than half of whichwere civilians. Millions died in
genocides
, including
the Holocaust
, and by massacres,starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory,
Germany
,
Austria
,
Japan
, and
Korea
wereoccupied, and German and Japanese leaders were tried for
war crimes
.
The
causes of World War II
included unresolved tensions in the
aftermath of World War I
and the rises of
fascism in Europe
and
militarism in Japan
. Key events preceding the warincluded
Japan's invasion of Manchuria
in 1931, the
Spanish Civil War
, the outbreak of the
Second Sino-Japanese War
in 1937, and Germany's
annexations of Austria
and
theSudetenland
. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939,when
Nazi Germany
, under
Adolf Hitler
,
invaded Poland
, leading the
United Kingdom
and
France
to declare war on Germany. Poland was divided between Germany and the
SovietUnion
under the
Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact
. In 1940, the Soviets
annexed the Baltic states
and
parts of Finland
and
Romania
. After the
fall of France
in June 1940, the war continuedmainly between Germany and the
British Empire
, with fighting in the
Balkans
,
Mediterranean, and Middle East
, the aerial
Battle of Britain
and
the Blitz
, and naval
Battleof the Atlantic
. Through campaigns and treaties, Germany gained control of much of
continental Europe
and
formed the Axis alliance
with
Italy
,
Japan
, and other countries. InJune 1941, Germany led
an invasion of the Soviet Union
, opening the
Eastern Front
andinitially making large territorial gains.
